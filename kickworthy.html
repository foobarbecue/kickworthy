<p>Kickstarter is <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/blog/accountability-on-kickstarter">not interested in providing information</a> about which projects turn out to be scams, which ones deliver late or never, and which ones are brilliant successes. 

There has been <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/kickstarter/comments/1j6ubm/complete_list_of_funded_kickstarter_projects_that/">some effort</a> to collect that sort of data, but is has been haphazard and incomplete. Kickworthy compiles outcomes of crowdfunded projects systematically based on user reports.</p>
